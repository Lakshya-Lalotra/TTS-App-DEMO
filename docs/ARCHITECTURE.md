# Speech-to-Text — Full Application Design

> Production-ready design for a real-time multilingual (code-switching Hindi↔English) speech-to-text application.

## 1. Executive summary

Goals:
- Partial results <300 ms; final <1 s for short utterances
- Strong code-switching handling (Hindi↔English)
- Personal vocabulary biasing and corrections
- Scalable, secure, privacy-friendly (GDPR/India)

Target users: call centers, learners, meetings, journalists, accessibility.

## 2. High-level architecture

```
[Browser Client] --WebRTC/WS--> [Ingress API (Signaling, Auth)] --> [Stream Router / Gateway] --> [ASR Workers (Streaming Transducer)]
                                                              |--> [Post-Processing (Punct, Transliterate, Rescore)]
                                                              |--> [Second-pass Reprocessor]
                                                              |--> [Context DB / User Vocab]
                                                              \--> [Logging / Metrics / Storage]
```

## 3. Component design (summary)

- Client (Web): WebRTC capture, low-latency UI, corrections, vocab.
- Ingress API: Auth, sessions, WS ingress, rate limiting.
- Stream Router: sticky sessions, load-aware routing.
- ASR Workers: GPU-backed streaming transducer, token conf, n-best.
- Post-Processing: punctuation, truecasing, transliteration, rescoring.
- Personalization: vocab storage and runtime biasing.
- Storage & Logging: transcripts DB, optional audio store.
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana, tracing with Jaeger.

## 4. Data models (summary)

- User, Session, Transcript, VocabItem (see API docs).

## 5. API surface (summary)

- REST: /api/v1/session, /api/v1/login, /api/v1/vocab
- WS: start, audio, end; server emits partial/final/nbest

## 6. Security & privacy

- TLS, JWT, mTLS internal, RBAC, encryption at rest, regionalization.

## 7. Deployment & infra

- Cloud or self-hosted K8s; Triton for model serving; NVIDIA device plugin.

## 8. Monitoring & observability

- Latency, WER, GPU utilization, concurrency; logs + traces.

## 9. Testing & QA

- Unit, integration (WS), load tests, curated accuracy sets.

## 10. MVP milestones

- Weeks 0–2: MVP with cloud ASR
- Weeks 3–6: vocab biasing, LID, punctuation
- Weeks 7–12: self-hosted ASR, rescoring, reprocessor, hardening

## 11. Repo layout (suggested)

```
